I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the {{< staticref "https://www.iast.fr/" "newtab">}}Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse{{< /staticref >}}. I hold a PhD in Politics from {{< staticref "https://as.nyu.edu/politics.html" "newtab" >}}New York University{{< /staticref >}} and a MSc in Economic and Social Sciences from {{< staticref "https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Bocconi/SitoPubblico_EN/Navigation+Tree/Home/" "newtab" >}}Bocconi University{{< /staticref >}}. 

My research studies the formation and change of social cleavages and identities, and their implications for contemporary societies. I have primary interests in the politics of ethnic and linguistic boundaries and in the mechanisms of inter-generational transmission of political preferences. I am also interested in the political economy of institutions and development.

I like to combine econometric tools for causal inference, archival fieldwork, and experimental methods. 

My research is published or forthcoming at *American Journal of Political Science* and *Comparative Political Studies* and has been funded by {{< staticref "https://www.wider.unu.edu/" "newtab" >}}UNU-WIDER{{< /staticref >}}, the {{< staticref "https://theihs.org/" "newtab" >}}Institute for Humane Studies{{< /staticref >}}, and other institutions.

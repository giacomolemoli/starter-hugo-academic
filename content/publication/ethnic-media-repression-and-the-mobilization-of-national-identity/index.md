## Abstract

Can media fuel support for ethnic parties? The nature and reach of modern mass media enable them to influence the political salience of cultural traits, a pre-requisite of ethnic politics; yet their effects on the political behavior of minorities appear mixed. I argue that non-political ethnic media can help coalesce grievances against the state along identity boundaries, favoring ethnic mobilization. I study the case of the Basque Country in the late phase of the Franco regime, where an independent radio station operated by pro-nationalist local clergy promoted the revival of regional language. Using a variety of contemporary and archival data, I show that exposure to ethnic radio increased support for new independentist parties, and that the effect is driven by linguistically hispanified municipalities with low historical support for Basque nationalism. I also show that radio increased bilingualism in subsequent generations, and contributed to the progressive ethnification of radical opposition.

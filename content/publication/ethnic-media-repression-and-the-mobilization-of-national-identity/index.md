## Abstract

Can media fuel support for ethnic parties? The nature and reach of modern media enable them to manipulate the political salience of cultural traits, a pre-requisite of theories of ethnic politics; yet the effects of ethnic media on the political behavior of minorities appear mixed. I argue that ethnic media with cultural content can help coalesce grievances against the state along identity boundaries, favoring ethnic mobilization. I study the case of the Basque Country between the late Franco regime and the Spanish democratic transition, where a local radio station operated by pro-nationalist Basque clergy promoted the revival of regional language and folklore. Using a variety of contemporary and archival data, I show that exposure to ethnic media increased support for new, radical independentist parties tied to ETA, and that the effect is driven by linguistically hispanicized municipalities with lower historical support for Basque
nationalism. Media can aggregate ethnic coalitions among communities threatened by cultural assimilation, especially if state violence sustains an ethnic cleavage.

## Abstract

How and when does violence shape political behavior in the long run? We propose that collective memories permit the inter-generational transmission of attitudes induced by violence and that changes in the political environment can influence behavior depending on the local salience of memories. We test this theory through a historical case of indiscriminate violence against civilians by French colonial troops in central Italy during World War II. Using an online survey with an embedded experiment, we show that memories of violence are locally transmitted across generations, correlate with political leaning, and affect attitudes toward immigration today. In a complementary study using data on electoral outcomes and party platforms from 1948 to 2018, we show that parties that increase the nationalist content of their manifesto gain more votes in formerly victimized communities, relative to similar but not victimized ones.

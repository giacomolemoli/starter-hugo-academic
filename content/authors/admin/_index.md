I am a 4th year PhD student in the {{< staticref "https://as.nyu.edu/politics.html" "newtab" >}}Wilf Family Department of Politics{{< /staticref >}}, New York University, and affiliated with the {{< staticref "https://www.identities-ideologies.org/" "newtab" >}}Identities and Ideologies Project{{< /staticref >}}. I hold a MSc in Economic and Social Sciences from {{< staticref "https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Bocconi/SitoPubblico_EN/Navigation+Tree/Home/" "newtab" >}}Bocconi University{{< /staticref >}}. In my research I study how institutions, political actors and local memories make ethnic and linguistic boundaries become salient, and the consequences for political competition and mobilization in culturally diverse societies. 

I use historical natural experiments and data from Europe, with a geographic focus on modern Spain, the Basque Country, Slovenia and Croatia. Methodologically, I like to combine econometric methods for causal inference and the use of original archival data to measure cultural traits. Another line of my work focuses on Ã©lites persistence and political development.

My research has been funded by {{< staticref "https://www.wider.unu.edu/" "newtab" >}}UNU-WIDER{{< /staticref >}} and the {{< staticref "https://theihs.org/" "newtab" >}}Institute for Humane Studies{{< /staticref >}}.

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at {{< staticref "https://www.fus.edu/" "newtab">}}Franklin University Switzerland{{< /staticref >}}, where I work on the SNSF-funded project {{< staticref "https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/10003605" "newtab">}}DIVIDE{{< /staticref >}}, led by <a href="https://oliverstrijbis.com/" target="_blank">Oliver Strijbis</a>. Before that, I was a Research Fellow at the {{< staticref "https://www.iast.fr/" "newtab" >}}Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse{{< /staticref >}}. I hold a PhD in Politics from {{< staticref "https://as.nyu.edu/politics.html" "newtab" >}}New York University{{< /staticref >}} and a MSc in Economic and Social Sciences from {{< staticref "https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Bocconi/SitoPubblico_EN/Navigation+Tree/Home/" "newtab" >}}Bocconi University{{< /staticref >}}. 

I study how social institutions and networks affect political participation and conflict. The main focus of my current work is:

- The politics of ethnic and linguistic boundaries in modern states

- Social influence in networks during and after violence

I also work on the political economy of development.

I am interested in combining design-based econometric analysis, data science, archival fieldwork, and experiments to test social scientific theories and enhance measurement. 

My research is published or forthcoming at the *American Journal of Political Science* and *Comparative Political Studies* and has been funded by {{< staticref "https://www.wider.unu.edu/" "newtab" >}}UNU-WIDER{{< /staticref >}}, the {{< staticref "https://theihs.org/" "newtab" >}}Institute for Humane Studies{{< /staticref >}}, and other institutions.
